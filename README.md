# TomatoPlantDisease

This is a tomato plant leaf disease detection model built using Resnet15 which predicts the leaf images uploaded by an user and detects the corresponding leaf disease associated with it . The dataset has been taken from Kaggle and has 10 classes. I have trained it on 2 epochs since the dataset is pretty large and was taking much time for a single epoch to be trained on.
